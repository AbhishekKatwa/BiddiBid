				At first the Login Page is shown..

			<div class="col-sm-4">
			<b>"XHR AJAX"</b>
			Features:Login<br/>
					Can able to resister with new names
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">

			Files that are used are,<br/>
			index.html<br/>
			LoginCheck.php (for logging in)<br/>
			Register.php (for registering)<br/>

			after logging in the Home page named first.html is lodded.<br/>
			here the user can see the products put by other users bcz there is no point showing my products in the bidding page as i am not interested in bidding the products hosted by me</br/>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
			Features:the product name is popped when i hover on the image
			<br/>the time gets decreased every second from each of the product and it is shown...Php file useed is GetProducts.php
			<br/>In GetProducts.php file i am reading contents from details.json file and keeping all required data in a strng and returing the string to client..
			the required data in the sense,products hosted by others..not me....i can know myname through username which i am storing at starting of all page.
			<br/>here i first fetch all the products hosted by other users and then keep it in the page....i am not going and querying for any new additions....and the timing i am handling it in the client side javascript itself.
			After having all products.....i should also kow if there are any new additions ....if any that product should be showed on top..
			<br/>technique i have used is, <b>COMET...</b>
			<br/> i only open a connection with the help of EventSource Object and if there are any additons that are automatically pushed by the server itself...server here is ServerPush.php ....serverPush will be keep watching the file called InfoPage.txt   any new addition are also logged in the InfoPage.txt....server will know about new additions through the log in the InfoPage.txt
			<br/>
			<br/>
			In COMET ...
			<br/>once all products are loaded.i will call monitor()
			which will do the connection trough EventSourceObject and then the servers responses will be taken and 
			<br/>will Call AddLatest() -> getItem(username,prodname)
			-> AddedNew_SSE.php (which will give me the item that is reuested)(here latest) ->addedNow() -> the product will be
			<br/>Added as Latest Producst on the top of all other products.
			<br/><br/><br/>
			Search button is provided where i have used technique <b>"SUBMISSION TROTTLE".</b>

			As user types something n the search box it will call Suggest() -> form where it will show the resposes in the div below the search box...whcih will call <b>"getNeeded.php"</b>
			<br/><br/><br/>
